## Browser Compatibility


I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/compatibility/chrome-screen.png) | Works as expected |
| Firefox | ![screenshot](documentation/compatibility/firefox-screen.png) | works as expected |
| Edge | ![screenshot](documentation/compatibility/edge-screen.png) | Works as expected |

## Responsiveness

The website was tested on the following browsers for responsiness with no problems found.
  - Chrome
  - Firefox
  - Edge

The website was also tested on numerous sized screens and responded to all sizes:-
  - Google Pixel 8 Pro 
  - Samsung Galaxy S22 PLUS 
  - iPhone 15
  - 15" 1080p laptop screen 
  - 24" 1080p desktop screen 
  - 27" 1440p desktop screen

The website was checked on various personal devices and [responsiveviewer.org](https://responsiveviewer.org/) was used to check others.

| Device | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1440p Desktop Monitor | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/1440p-desktop-responsive.png) | Works as expected |
| 1080p Desktop Monitor | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/1080p-desktop-responsive.png) | Works as expected |
| 1080p Portrait Desktop Monitor | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/1080p-desktop-portrait-responsive.png) | Works as expected |
| Google Pixel 8 Pro | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/pixel-8-pro-responsive.png) | Works as expected |

Please note some of the screenshots above have been re-scaled to be easily viewed.

Chrome development tools were also used throughout the design process to check responsiveness and breakpoints. Adjustments were made accordingly.
